## RoR Project Documentation (docs/)

Standard structure to include in each project:

```
docs/
├── index.md
├── 01_project_overview.md
├── 02_setup_instructions.md
├── 03_architecture.md
├── 04_domain_model.md
└── 05_prompt_canvas.md
```

Each file should explain not just **what** but **why** decisions were made, with step‑by‑step detail and inline code examples.
